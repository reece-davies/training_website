Inessential Changes (don't really need): 
- Allow for autofill on failed form submissions
- Do something with "remember me" on login
- Finetune error handling response messages
- Create exercise number for "new-circuit" page
- Refine "Add exercise" button in "new-circuit.php" to not remove previous exercise input values.
- Better navigation back to specific programme (from "change X" - back buttons)
- Allow for input boxes to keep text when it is selected, until user starts typing
- Change the styling of the new-programme popup box form
- Allow for 'Edit programmes' to have a hover effect
- Implement better JavaScript into the forms (better error exceptions)
- Add a numbering system to displayed exercises in a circuit
- Allow user to add or remove exercises for circuit

Important Changes (that HAVE to be done before submission):
- Change the index page (and footer)

Potential Changes (I would like but are not essential):
- Show exercise/circuit history
- Allow user to log sessions
- Allow user to delete programmes and circuits {add delete button on programmes listview}
- Change programme list to be chunky blocks (or make table differ from circuits table)
- Allow user to change password (forgot password)
- Allow for better way of indiciation of ability to edit circuits (tooltip on hover?)

NOTE: Add column to database to state whether programme/circuit has been deleted.
      If deleted, have specific value. When items are loaded on the website, have
      it check for this column. If the column has the specific value (eg "deleted"),
      skip this item. Will need to figure out way of ACTUALLY deleting items from
      the database for when there are loads of users. Use of specific value can 
      be shown on social network youtube guide (final/final-ish episode).

--- Plan for changing circuit contents ---
// Scan database for this specific circuit
// Get the circuit <item we're changing> from circuits tables
// Start new database query; get MAX outdated_X_id from archived table
// Start new database query; post old circuit <item> in archived table
// UPDATE <item> to new circuit <item> in circuits table
